Project Title: Clinic Booking System Database

Description:
This is a MySQL database designed for a clinic booking system. It allows patients to schedule appointments with doctors, stores patient and doctor information, and tracks medical history and billing details.

How to Run/Setup the Project:

1. **Import SQL File:** To import the database schema into your MySQL server, follow these steps:
  - Open your preferred SQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench)
  - Click on "Import" or equivalent option
  - Select the clinic_booking_system.sql file from this project's root directory
  - Choose the database name as clinic_bookings

2. **Create a new MySQL database:** If you prefer to create a new database manually, use the following command:
  - CREATE DATABASE clinic_bookings;

3. **Import SQL File into New Database:** After creating the new database, import the `clinic-booking-system.sql` file into it using the same steps as mentioned above.
4. **Run Queries:** Once imported, you can run queries to populate data and test the functionality of the database.

**Note:**

* Before running any queries, make sure to replace any placeholders (e.g., `root` user password) with actual values from your MySQL configuration.
* This is a basic implementation, and you may want to add additional features or tables based on your specific requirements.
